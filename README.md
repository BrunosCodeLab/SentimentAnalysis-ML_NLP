# Sentiment Analysis

This project explores sentiment analysis as an application of natural language processing (NLP) in tourism, specifically through the analysis of guest reviews. During the development process, I gained valuable experience in data handling, text preprocessing, training sentiment analysis models, and evaluating their performance.

# Project Overview
This project aims to create a user-oriented solution for sentiment analysis, allowing users to analyze guest reviews via various input options (<ins>**Menu is written in Croatian</ins>**):

The user interface is designed to streamline the process, providing quick and actionable insights from guest reviews. While the model shows strong performance, it occasionally misclassifies even obvious positive or negative reviews. This highlights the inherent imperfections of machine learning models, as no model is ever 100% accurate.

# Technologies Used
The project was developed using:

- Python: Core programming language.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning and evaluation.
- NLTK / SpaCy: For natural language processing.
- Pandas / NumPy: For data manipulation and analysis.


# Lessons Learned
This project has  enhanced my understanding of NLP, particularly in:

- Text preprocessing and data cleaning.
- Training and evaluating sentiment analysis models.
- Getting familiar with Google Colab.
